Classical Elements
==================

This is a SVG project with 6 icons that represent the classical elements:

* Earth
* Wind
* Fire
* Water
* Ã†ther
* Unity

The last element, *Unity*, was newly created and added by me and other 5 icons are from the classical elements project by **Professor Clayton**.
